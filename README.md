CMO – Copley Motion Objects
Copley Motion Objects (CMO) simplifies the creation of Windows-based software for the control of Copley amplifiers over a CANopen network. CMO is an API that gives programmers access to an amplifier’s CANopen functions without having to learn the complexities of the underlying network protocol. CMO is a managed .NET assembly, which means that it can be used with client code that supports .NET assemblies.
